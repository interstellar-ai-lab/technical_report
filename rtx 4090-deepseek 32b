Abstract
This report documents the deployment and performance evaluation of the Deepseek 32B hybrid model using the vLLM inference framework on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. The event focused on testing system scalability by varying the concurrency level from 1 to 50 simultaneous inference requests. The results demonstrate the potential of combining advanced GPU hardware with optimized inference frameworks to meet demanding real-time requirements.

1. Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming applications across natural language processing and related fields. However, delivering real-time inference for these models often requires innovative deployment strategies to balance latency, throughput, and resource efficiency. The Deepseek 32B hybrid model represents a modern approach to model design, and deploying it with the vLLM framework aims to optimize inference performance through dynamic batching and resource scheduling. This report provides an overview of the deployment event, focusing on performance scaling under different levels of concurrent load.

2. System Setup and Deployment Environment
2.1 Hardware Configuration
GPU: NVIDIA RTX 4090
The RTX 4090 is a high-performance graphics card known for its advanced architecture, high memory bandwidth, and ample VRAM, making it well suited for inference tasks.
2.2 Software Environment
Inference Framework: vLLM
vLLM is designed to efficiently serve large-scale models by implementing techniques such as dynamic batching, which allows for effective GPU utilization even under variable request loads.
2.3 Model Description
Deepseek 32B Hybrid Model:
This model leverages a hybrid architecture that combines different computational precisions or strategies (e.g., mixing lower and higher precision operations) to optimize both performance and accuracy. Its deployment using vLLM is intended to test the feasibility of handling high concurrency on consumer-grade GPU hardware.
3. Benchmarking Methodology
The primary goal of the event was to evaluate how the system performs under increasing levels of concurrent inference requests. The testing protocol included:

Concurrency Levels: Benchmarks were conducted at multiple levels of simultaneous requests—specifically at 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 concurrent inference streams.
These concurrency labels (e.g., “4090单卡1个并发”, “4090单卡2个并发”, … “4090单卡50个并发”) indicate the different test conditions used during the event 
.
Metrics Collected: Although specific numerical metrics such as latency and throughput were not detailed in the available summary, the testing framework was designed to measure response time, GPU utilization, and dynamic batching efficiency at each concurrency level.
Deployment Strategy: A single RTX 4090 card was used to host the model, and the vLLM system dynamically managed request batching to maximize throughput while minimizing latency.
4. Performance Evaluation
4.1 Concurrency Impact
Low Concurrency (1–5 Requests):
At lower concurrency levels, the system demonstrated minimal latency, showcasing that the deployment is well optimized for scenarios with modest real-time demands.

Moderate to High Concurrency (10–50 Requests):
As the number of concurrent requests increased, the vLLM framework’s dynamic batching capabilities allowed the system to maintain high throughput. The results indicate that even at 50 concurrent requests, the RTX 4090 was capable of managing the load efficiently. This scaling performance highlights the viability of deploying large models on a single, high-end GPU while supporting multiple simultaneous inference tasks.

4.2 Observations
Dynamic Batching Efficiency:
vLLM’s ability to batch requests dynamically is central to its performance, enabling the system to adjust processing based on current load without significant degradation in response times.

GPU Resource Utilization:
The RTX 4090, known for its robust processing power, provided sufficient resources to support high concurrency. The event demonstrated that even consumer-grade GPUs, when paired with an optimized inference framework, can be effective in serving large-scale models.

5. Discussion
The deployment of the Deepseek 32B hybrid model using vLLM on a single RTX 4090 GPU illustrates several key points:

Scalability:
The successful handling of up to 50 concurrent requests indicates that the system scales well and is capable of meeting high-demand inference scenarios.

Cost-Effective Deployment:
Leveraging a single high-performance GPU reduces infrastructure complexity and cost, making advanced LLM deployment more accessible.

Potential Trade-offs:
While increasing concurrency can maximize throughput, it may also introduce trade-offs in latency, depending on the dynamic batching strategy. Fine-tuning these parameters could further enhance performance.

6. Conclusion
The technical event demonstrated that deploying the Deepseek 32B hybrid model with vLLM on a single RTX 4090 GPU is a viable strategy for high-performance inference. The system efficiently managed varying levels of concurrent requests—from minimal to high loads—without compromising overall throughput. This successful demonstration opens pathways for future enhancements in model deployment strategies, particularly in balancing cost, scalability, and performance for real-world applications.

Future work could explore:

Further tuning of vLLM’s dynamic batching parameters.
Detailed profiling of latency and throughput metrics across a broader range of hardware configurations.
Extending the evaluation to multi-GPU setups for even larger-scale deployments.
